# **Terminating an Instance**

Once you have finished with your Atmosphere instance you will need to
terminate this instance. If you are not done with the instance and will
use it again in a short amount of time, you can stop or suspend that
instance. For more on these options, see the [Atmosphere
manual](https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/atmman/Suspending%2C+Stopping%2C+Rebooting%2C+Resuming%2C+Starting%2C+Moving%2C+and+Deleting+Instances).
