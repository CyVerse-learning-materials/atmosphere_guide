# Atmosphere Guide

## Goal

[Atmosphere](http://www.cyverse.org/atmosphere) is one of the most
versatile components of the CyVerse CI. Anything that you would normally
be able to do with your local laptop/desktop, you can do on a virtual
machine in the Atmosphere cloud. This guide will cover the basics you
need to get started using Atmosphere. For the full documentation, see
the [Atmosphere
Manual](https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/atmman/Atmosphere+Manual+Table+of+Contents)
on the CyVerse wiki.
