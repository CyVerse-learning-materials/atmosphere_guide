# Logging in to Atmosphere

Atmosphere presents a variety of features, starting with the Atmosphere
Dashboard you will see at login. While it may be slightly overwhelming,
we will focus on the features a first-time user would likely interact
with. Return to the Learning Center and Atmosphere Manual to learn more
about the advanced features not covered here.

**Some things to remember about the platform**

-   You must have access to Atmosphere to launch an instance. If you are
    not sure you have access, go back to the instructions at the
    beginning of this guide
-   Atmosphere works on a very transparent allocation model. Every user
    has a defined amount of resources (CPUs, disk space, etc.) and time
    they can use these resources. We are always happy to work with users
    to increase these allocations, but ultimately there are limits. You
    can be a good community member by only using resources when you need
    them, and not leaving instances aimlessly running (the proverbial
    'leaving the lights on').

## Logging on and viewing your resources

 1.  Login to Atmosphere at <https://atmo.cyverse.org/> and click the
     'Login' link on the upper right-hand side of the screen. Enter
     your CyVerse credential and sign in.

 2.  Upon login, you will be directed to the [Atmosphere
     Dashboard](https://atmo.cyverse.org/application/dashboard). Much
     more about all the dashboard features is available in the
     [Atmosphere
     Manual](https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/atmman/About+the+Atmosphere+Dashboard)
     , but you can see the number of instances you have running, and
     percent of your allocation used. You can also see an history of
     instances launched.

> **Tip**
>
> Your allocation (a measure of how many instances you have running,
> their size, and the amount of time they have been active)
> automatically refreshes monthly. If you run out of allocation, you
> can click the **'NEED MORE?'** button to request an increase. When
> you exceed your allocation, your instances are suspended. You will
> not lose saved data, but running processes will be stopped. See
> the Atmosphere section in the [CyVerse service-level
> agreement](http://www.cyverse.org/service-level-agreement#Atmo)
> for details and definitions related to our allocation policies.
