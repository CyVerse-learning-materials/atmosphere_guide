**Logging in to Atmosphere**
----------------------------


Atmosphere presents a variety of features, starting with the Atmosphere
Dashboard you will see at login. While it may be slightly overwhelming, we will
focus on the features a first-time user would likely interact with. Return to
the Learning Center and Atmosphere Manual to learn more about the advanced
features not covered here.

**Some things to remember about the platform**

.. #### Comment: Optional - Insert platform logo

- You must have access to Atmosphere to launch an instance. If you are not
  sure you have access, go back to the instructions at the beginning of this
  guide
- Atmosphere works on a very transparent allocation model. Every user has a
  defined amount of resources (CPUs, disk space, etc.) and time they can use
  these resources. We are always happy to work with users to increase these
  allocations, but ultimately there are limits. You can be a good community
  member by only using resources when you need them, and not leaving instances
  aimlessly running (the proverbial 'leaving the lights on').

*Logging on and viewing your resources*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Login to Atmosphere at `https://atmo.cyverse.org/ <https://atmo.cyverse.org/>`_
     and click the 'Login' link on the upper right-hand side of the screen. Enter
     your CyVerse credential and sign in.

  2. Upon login, you will be directed to the `Atmosphere Dashboard <https://atmo.cyverse.org/application/dashboard>`_.
     Much more about all the dashboard features is available in the `Atmosphere
     Manual <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/atmman/About+the+Atmosphere+Dashboard>`_
     , but you can see the number of instances you have running, and percent of
     your allocation used. You can also see an history of instances launched.

     .. Tip::
       Your allocation (a measure of how many instances you have running, their
       size, and the amount of time they have been active) automatically
       refreshes monthly. If you run out of allocation, you can click the
       |need_more| 'NEED MORE?' button to request an increase. When you exceed
       your allocation, your instances are suspended. You will not lose saved
       data, but running processes will be stopped. See the Atmosphere section
       in the `CyVerse service-level agreement <http://www.cyverse.org/service-level-agreement#Atmo>`_
       for details and definitions related to our allocation policies.
