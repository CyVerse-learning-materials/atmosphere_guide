**Terminating an Instance**
---------------------------

Once you have finished with your Atmosphere instance you will need to terminate
this instance. If you are not done with the instance and will use it again in
a short amount of time, you can stop or suspend that instance. For more on these
options, see the `Atmosphere manual <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/atmman/Suspending%2C+Stopping%2C+Rebooting%2C+Resuming%2C+Starting%2C+Moving%2C+and+Deleting+Instances>`_.

*Terminating an Instance*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  .. warning::
      Once an instance is terminated, all data on that instance is unrecoverable.
      Ensure that any data you wish to save is transferred to a persistent location
      such as the CyVerse Data Store or an Atmosphere volume.


  1. If necessary, login to |Atmosphere| and locate
     the instance you are terminating in a given project.

  2. Click on the instance name to get to that instances page. You should see an
     "Actions" menu on the right-hand side of the page.

  3. Click **Delete** to terminate the instance; read the warning, and click
     'YES, DELETE THIS INSTANCE' when you are ready to proceed - remember
     **all data still on this instance will be lost.**
