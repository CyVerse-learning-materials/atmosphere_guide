Terminating an Instance
-----------------------

Once you have finished with your Atmosphere instance you will need to terminate
this instance. If you are not done with the instance and will use it again in
a short amount of time, you can Stop or Suspend that instance. For more on these
options, see the `Atmosphere manual <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/atmman/Suspending%2C+Stopping%2C+Rebooting%2C+Resuming%2C+Starting%2C+Moving%2C+and+Deleting+Instances>`_.

     the instance you are terminating in a given project.

  2. Click on the instance name to get to that instances page. You should see an
     "Actions" menu on the right-hand side of the page.
